# HDL-CAD
A New Digital Design System

A powerful tool that generates Verilog HDL for digital circuits.

Features a graphical user interface that allows for creating modules visually.

Uses QT for user interface design, essentially C++, and obect oriented python for Verilog generation

Currently supports:
  * simple manipulation of logic gates
  * generation of modules with any input size

![logic gates](https://github.com/ATariq1/HDL-CAD/blob/master/images/Screenshot from 2018-02-21 00-02-10.png)

Future features:
  * allow custom modules to be created with custom inputs, outputs, sizes and port names.

  * support for all Verilog operators. 
  
TODO:
  * connect python to QT interface
  * create custom verilog input method
  * add fields to logic gates
  * add line connection system
  * add bus sizing system
  * add grid system
  * add resizing system
  * add custom modules
