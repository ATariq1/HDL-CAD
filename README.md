# HDL-CAD
A New Digital Design System

A powerful tool that generates Verilog HDL for digital circuits.

Features a graphical user interface that allows for creating modules visually.

Uses QT for user interface design, essentially C++, and obect oriented python for Verilog generation

Currently supports:
  * simple manipulation of logic gates
  * generation of modules with any input size

Future features:
  * allow custom modules to be created with custom inputs, outputs, sizes and port names.

  * support for all Verilog operators.
